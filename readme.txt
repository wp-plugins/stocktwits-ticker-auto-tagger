== Description ==

An auto tagger plugin designed to automatically include valid stock ticker symbols as tags, along with their official name.

The plugin works by detecting $ticker symbols such as $appl or $gm and converting it to a tag, along with an automated process to fetch the stock name from Yahoo! Finance and include the company name as an additional tag for search engine optimization of your financial blog.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this work? =

When you make a post in WordPress, simply indicate that you're posting a stock ticker using the dollar sign symbol. For example, $gm to indicate you're posting about General Motors Common and the plugin will automatically add gm as well as General Motors Common to your post tags.

= Can I automatically link the tag? =

We have another plugin called the StockTwits Ticker Link (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stocktwits-ticker-links/) that will automatically link your $tickers to social media streams for the ticker.
